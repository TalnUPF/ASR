The proposed changes also would allow executives to report exercises of options later and less often
Apparently the commission did not really believe in this ideal
But about 25% of the insiders according to SEC figures file their reports late
The SEC will probably vote on the proposal early next year he said
Not all those who wrote oppose the changes
According to some estimates the rule changes would cut insider filings by more than a third
The SEC's Mr Lane vehemently disputed those estimates
The proposed rules also would be tougher on the insiders still required to file reports he said
Companies would be compelled to publish in annual proxy statements the names of insiders who fail to file reports on time
Many investors wrote asking the SEC to require insiders to report their purchases and sales immediately not a month later
 Investors who want to change the required timing should write their representatives in Congress he added

W Ed Tyler 37 years old a senior vice president at this printing concern was elected president of its technology group a new position
The oboist Heinz Holliger has taken a hard line about the problem:
Richard Stoltzman has taken a gentler more audience friendly approach
But you can't dismiss Mr Stoltzman's music or his motives as merely commercial and lightweight
He believes in what he plays and he plays superbly
His recent appearance at the Metropolitan Museum dubbed A Musical Odyssey was a case in point
It felt more like a party or a highly polished jam session with a few friends than a classical concert
He launched into Saint Saens's The Swan from Carnival of the Animals a favorite encore piece for cellists with lovely glossy tone and no bite
Mr Stoltzman introduced his colleagues: Bill Douglas pianist/bassoonist/composer and an old buddy from Yale and jazz bassist Eddie Gomez
Bach's Air followed
Deep Peace also featured a slide show of lovely but predictable images of clouds beaches deserts sunsets etc
That went over the permissible line for warm and fuzzy feelings
Was this why some of the audience departed before or during the second half?
Or was it because Ms Collins had gone?
Mr Reich's new Different Trains for string quartet uses the technique magisterially
Mr Stoltzman must have worried that his audience might not be able to take it: He warned us in advance that New York Counterpoint lasts 11½ minutes
Is this the future of chamber music?
What's next?
Slides to illustrate Shostakovich quartets?
But it was neither deep nor lasting: light entertainment that was no substitute for an evening of Brahms

In fact he liberated the US from one of the world's most corrupt organizations – UNESCO
This is the UN group that managed to traduce its own charter of promoting education science and culture
Ever since the remaining members have been desperate for the United States to rejoin this dreadful group
Now UNESCO apologists are lobbying President Bush to renege on President Reagan's decision to depart
The Orwellian New World Information Order would give government officials rights against the press
UNESCO somehow converted the founding UN ideals of individual rights and liberty into peoples' rights
UNESCO is now holding its biennial meetings in Paris to devise its next projects
Mr Mayor's hope that references to press freedom would survive unamended seems doomed to failure

The Babelists of the United Nations are experts at obfuscation
The researchers said they have isolated a plant gene that prevents the production of pollen
On a commercial scale the sterilization of the pollen producing male part has only been achieved in corn and sorghum feed grains
In a labor intensive process the seed companies cut off the tassels of each plant making it male sterile
They sow a row of male fertile plants nearby which then pollinate the male sterile plants
The vast majority of the US corn crop now is grown from hybrid seeds produced by seed companies
A similar technique is almost impossible to apply to other crops such as cotton soybeans and rice
Mr Leemans said this genetic manipulation doesn't hurt the growth of that plant
They attached a second gene for herbicide resistance to the pollen inhibiting gene
Both genes are then inserted into a few greenhouse plants which are then pollinated and allowed to mature and produce seed
One technique developed by some of these companies involves a chemical spray supposed to kill only a plant's pollen
There is a large market out there hungry for hybrid seeds he said
Nevertheless he said he is negotiating with Plant Genetic to acquire the technology to try breeding hybrid cotton
Already the consequences are being felt by other players in the financial markets  even governments
What triggered the latest clash was a skirmish over the timing of a New Zealand government bond issue
The dispute shows clearly the global power of Japan's financial titans
Aside from Nomura's injured pride the biggest victim so far has been the New Zealand government
New Zealand's finance minister David Caygill lashed out at such suggestions
It may very well be what the Japanese banks want he told Radio New Zealand
Both sides are jealously guarding their turf and relations have been at a flashpoint for months
The banks badly want to break into all aspects of the securities business
And their suspicions of each other run deep
In the past year both have tried to stretch the limits of their businesses

When he sent letters offering 1250 retired major leaguers the chance of another season 730 responded
For some players the lure is money up to $15000 a month
Others just released from the majors hope the senior league will be their bridge back into the big time
(No one has worked out the players' average age but most appear to be in their late 30s)
There will be a lot of malice
Men who have played hard all their lives aren't about to change their habits he says
